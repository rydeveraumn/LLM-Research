# LLM-Research
A repository dedicated to exploring Natural Language Processing and Large Language Models. Dive into advanced research, algorithms, and applications shaping the future of NLP and AI.

## Setup
There is a `requirements.txt` available as well as `pre-commit` tools to setup the project.

For both Mac and Linux, you can proceed with the installation of the Python dependencies from your `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Note: These instructions assume that you have Python and pip already installed on your system. If that's not the case, you'll need to install those first. Also, if you're using a Python virtual environment, ensure that you've activated the environment before running these commands.

### Pre-Commit Hooks ðŸ¤–
[Precommit Documentation](https://pre-commit.com)

To conclude, we've integrated pre-commit hooks to maintain a consistent standard and style across all contributed code.

Here's how you can install and set up the pre-commit hooks:

1. First, you need to install `pre-commit`. You can do this with pip:

```bash
pip install pre-commit
```

2. Then, navigate to your project directory, where the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file is located:

```bash
cd LLM-Research
```

3. In the project directory, run the following command to install the pre-commit hooks:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

With these steps completed, the pre-commit hooks are now set up. They will automatically run checks on your code each time you try to commit changes in this repository. If the checks pass, the commit will be allowed; if they fail, the commit will be blocked, and you'll need to fix the issues before trying again.
